This is Lab assignment 2

I have changed the train_model.py, eval.py and test.py

train_model.py - I have added three more models(RandomForest, DecisionTree and Gradient Boost Classifier)
Eval.py - I have now changed the code to save the metrics directly into metrics folder(Saves all the three model metrics: F1 score and accuracy score)
